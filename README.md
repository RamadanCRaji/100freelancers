## :page_with_curl: About

100freelancers was originally created to help members of the 100devs agency keep track of their client outreach. Rather than using spreadsheets, which can be messy and difficult to read, 100freelancers can be used instead to easily add, view, and track clients, as well as progress made on client work.

## :wrench: Structure

The wireframe below outlines the project's models and general layout. Authentication is done through Passport's Discord strategy.

## Progress

Currently, the project has functional authentication and session storage through Passport, as well as functional adding of clients and outreach. There is also support for light/dark mode using DaisyUI. See below for screenshots!

## :memo: Installation

This app uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage its dependences and packages.

1. Fork and clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devlarabar/100freelancers.git
    ```

2. Run the following in both the `client` and `server` directories:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create an `.env` file in `server/config/` _and_ in `client/`. Copy everything from the respective `.env.example` files in both directories into these new files. **Do not delete the example!**  
  For example, run:

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  to copy the contents of `.env.example` into a new file named `.env`

4. We have a local MongoDB instance set up through Docker.
   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) will need to be installed to run the database. You can manage it using the following commands:

    To start the local MongoDB instance, run:
    ```bash
    npm run db:up
    ```
    To stop the local MongoDB instance, run:
    ```bash
    npm run db:stop
    ```

    With the local MongoDB instance in place, you can now connect directly without the need for MongoDB Atlas during development.

    To connect to the local MongoDB instance, follow these steps:

    1. Open MongoDB Compass.
    2. In the MongoDB Compass connection dialog, locate the "Connection String" field.
    3. In your .env file, located in the server directory, copy the DB_STRING, then paste this DB_STRING value into the "Connection String" field in MongoDB Compass.
    4. Click "Connect" to establish a connection to your local MongoDB instance.

5. To run the app locally, navigate to the `client` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Then navigate to the `server` directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm run db:up
    npm run serve
    ```

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute! The following simplified example of the git workflow is what we will be following for the development of this app.

2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
